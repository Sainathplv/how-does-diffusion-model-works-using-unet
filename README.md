# how-does-diffusion-model-works-using-unet
model devolped in this is a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a U-Net architecture, which is commonly used in denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM). The U-Net architecture is known for its ability to capture both local and global features in images, making it well-suited for image generation tasks.

# L1_Sampling.ipynb
This function generates samples using a DDPM. It starts with random noise and iteratively refines the samples over time.
samples are initialized with random noise of the same shape as the target images.
intermediate is an array used to store samples at different timesteps for visualization.
The for loop iterates backward through the timesteps. At each timestep, it predicts the noise (eps) added to the samples and then denoises the samples.
The denoise_add_noise function is used to remove the predicted noise and add some random noise back in to avoid collapsing to a single point.
The function returns the final samples and the intermediate samples for visualization.

# L2_Training.ipynb
This code snippet is part of the training loop for the DDPM model.
It iterates over the epochs and the data batches. For each batch:
optimizer.zero_grad() clears the gradients from the previous step.
x_0 is the original image, and t is the timestep. They are moved to the device (e.g., GPU).
noise is random noise, and x_t is the noisy image at timestep t.
eps_theta is the predicted noise by the model.
The loss is calculated as the mean squared error between the predicted noise and the actual noise.
The gradients are computed with loss.backward(), and the optimizer updates the model parameters with optimizer.step()

Set up the training loop, which includes:
Forward pass: Pass a batch of images and corresponding timesteps through the model to predict the noise.
Loss calculation: Compute the mean squared error between the predicted noise and the actual noise added to the images.
Backward pass: Compute gradients and update model parameters using an optimizer.
Save model checkpoints at regular intervals.
Load a trained model checkpoint.
Use the sampling function (similar to L1) to generate images from noise using the trained model.
Visualize the sampled images to see the quality improvement compared to the untrained model.

# L3_Context.ipynb
This function is similar to sample_ddpm but includes an additional context parameter.
The context is passed to the model along with the samples and timesteps. It is used to condition the generation process on specific attributes.
The rest of the function follows the same process as sample_ddpm, generating samples conditioned on the provided context.

Adapt the DDPM model to accept context information as an additional input.
Modify the training loop to include context information when passing data through the model.

Define a sampling function that conditions the image generation on the provided context.
Generate images conditioned on specific attributes using the trained model with context.
Visualize the contextually sampled images to observe how the model generates images based on the given context.


# L4_FastSampling.ipynb
This function implements the DDIM sampling algorithm, which is a faster alternative to the standard DDPM sampling.
The main difference is the number of timesteps n, which is typically much smaller than the timesteps used in DDPM.
The denoise_add_noise_ddim function is similar to denoise_add_noise but adapted for the DDIM algorithm.
The function iteratively refines the samples using fewer steps, resulting in faster sampling.

Introduce and implement a faster sampling algorithm, such as Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM).
Modify the sampling function to use the fast sampling algorithm.

Compare the speed of the standard DDPM sampling with the fast sampling algorithm.
Visualize the sampled images from both methods to ensure the quality of the fast-sampled images is comparable to the standard-sampled images.
